## Welcome to Leonard's blog, where we discuss everything essential.

### Mar 2022 - Proving to the world who you want to be
It is difficult to change career paths in life. Once people see you as "that guy" (i.e. a specialist in one field), it's very difficult to deviate from that image and switch careers. I noticed this myself when attempting to switch from life sciences engineering (a rather confusing nomenclature meant to describe a mix of molecular biology and computational science) to more pure computer science with a focus on machine learning. In fact, I still am, and the pursuit is rather difficult. But this journey also presents me with a deep sense of meaning. And the trajectory of the course I am taking, while still facing much headwind, is a future I truly see myself in, regardless of outside noise.

Even great artists such as Kanye West struggled with this phenomenon. As a reputable music producer in the early 2000s, when he was creating beats for labels such as Jay Z's Roc-A-Fella Music, it was notoriously difficult for him to make others view him as a rapper. It would take years of dedication and sacrifice to get there, and constantly correcting people for considering him a producer or producer-rapper when all he wanted to be was a rapper. No comparing to anyone else but the MCs. He had to so firmly believe in his vision that he distorted his own reality and that of others around him (and even the world?) in the process.

Nietzsche put it best when he said: "Every great man is an actor of his own ideal."

### Jan 2022 - On the importance of writing
I believe it is imperative to write at least once in a while, as this is the easiest way to structure one's thoughts and draft a better plan for the future. Writing is essentially the same thing as thinking, and perhaps what enables proper thinking to begin with.

Many software engineers are realizing that hard software skills are not what is necessary to rise the corporate ranks and lead large teams. One also needs proficient writing and communication skills which enable teams to focus around a common goal and reach true milestones on a regular basis.

### Jan 2022 - First baby steps

It's been a month since I first started this blog and it's so interesting in life how your goals change and morph into different things so quickly. I am trying to orient my life as much as possible towards being a software engineer and will start my MS thesis next month at the Institute for Machine Learning at ETH Zurich. This will hopefully teach me invaluable skills in machine learning / data science as well as software best practices.

I think the next steps are to learn all the necessary skills to become a full-stack software engineer, including Python with Django/Flask, data management systems such as PostgreSQL, perhaps some Javascript, MongoDB, Docker, Ruby/Rails, familiarity with servers and of course deep knowledge of APIs! This especially focuses on the backend so that I can build e.g. real-world web applications. I already have a great side project idea that is perfect to learn all of this (TBA) and I will document my path along the way to see my progress. Excited for the future!

### Dec 2021 - The Master Plan

You might be wondering why I'm creating this blog. I'm wondering that myself, especially considering I have a bunch of deadlines coming up for the end of the semester - oh well. But a key part of life is to better oneself and have audacious goals that push you to become a better version of yourself.

Now you might ask yourself: where do you want to be in 5 years? What do you want your life to be like? The truth is, people have the power to change their lives more than they believe. We always overestimate what we can achieve in the short-term and _massively_ underestimate what we can achieve in the long-term.

For my life, I would like to start a family in 5 years. Maybe sooner. And for that, I need two things. First, I want a high enough salary to support a family as the sole income generator. Second, I want a job that allows me to work from home (WFH) at least partially so I get to experience the joys of watching your kid grow up.

I think both of these criteria point to one job where I also possess reasonable expertise: software engineer. Now I'm not a computer scientist by training. I studied Bioengineering in university and haven't had any paid work in software, yet. All I've seen so far is basic classes in C++ programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), as well as machine learning in Python.

It's also hard to define what the role "software engineer" really means. There are numerous roles in this wide field and it ranges from website design, network security, data management, to things that are more centered around data science or machine learning. It is not perfectly clear which avenue I will take, but in either case I will have to gain deeper knowledge in OOP, software lifecycle, CD/CI, data structures and algorithms, and much more.

I've seen plenty of examples of people with (considerably) less programming exerience getting a 6-figure job as a software engineer, so why can't I? I think a lofty goal would be to get a software engineering position with a total salary above $200,000 within the next 3 years, and $500,000 by age 30. I know it might sound tough, but with enough hard work I know it's possible. I just need to figure out the right plan to get there.
